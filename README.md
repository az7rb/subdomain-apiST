## subdomain-apiST

SecurityTrails has an extremely robust API that can be used to enumerate subdomains.
This little script is designed to query their API and parse the results into a file that is ready to be sent to tools like httpx!
Usage is pretty simple.

Step 4:
```
chmod +x subdomain-apiST.sh
```
Step 5:
```
./subdomain-apiST.sh [domain.com]
```

This will write all of the enumerated subdomains to the specified output file and will be ready to be passed to other tools.

Happy hunting!
